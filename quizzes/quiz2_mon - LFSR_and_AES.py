# Consider an LFSR with coefficients [p_0, ..., p_9] = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0,] and initial value [s_0, ..., s_9] = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]. Generate the next 10 bits [s_{10}, ..., s_{19}] of the output of this lsfr.

# Use Asad-Final-Code/lfsr.py



# Which of the following statements about the AES encryption process is correct?
# - A. AES is a Feistel network where encryption and decryption are identical except for tho round keys.

# False, AES is not a Feistel network.

# - B. AES performs encryption on a 64-bit block and uses 16 different S-boxes. one for each byte.

# False, AES operates on a 128-bit block and uses 16 different S-boxes.

# - C. AES operates on a 4 4 byte state matrix. applying nonlinear and linear layers in each round.

# True, AES operates on a 4x4 byte state matrix, applying nonlinear/confusion (SubBytes) and linear/diffusion (ShiftRows, MixColumns) layers in each round.

# - D. AES mixes rows instead of columns in the MixColumns layer.

# False, AES mixes columns in the MixColumns layer.
